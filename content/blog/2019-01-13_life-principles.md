If you are reading this, welcome. But before you continue, let me warn you this won't be a technical blog post. What follows is a personal stance for self-improvement, if you are not interested in my internal thought process you can stop reading here and it will save you some time.

I'm a person of principles. But my principles are not the same as 5 years ago, and I'm glad this is the case because it shows how much I evolved over time. This last year I've learned a ton of things and I believe it changed how I look at the world. But I've also found I had lost perspective of my past. You can look back to see which direction you are going, and I found I barely remember what the drivers were that kept me going to a few years back, all I have is a distorted vision of what I thought and what I managed to achieve, but not how the thought process relates to the outcomes.

Like some kind of time capsule, I expect this post to survive for my future self, to remember what kept me awake at night and how this year helped me develop my ideology and personality over time. I consider doing this over the course of a lifetime with the assumption that year over year it will provide all the data points to construct a well defined track. To predict the future? Just extend the line.

Do not expect anyone will understand you.

I have a lot of stuff in your plate, so does everyone else. Duh! Discovery of the year, right ?. I can not understate how easy it is to forget about this in the heat of the moment. Here is an example to illustrate.

A couple years ago I was on summer holidays with my partner my parents-in-law and my sister-in-law and her partner. It would be a fantastic trip if it was not because I added an element of chaos to it. It started with my preconceptions; I was not feeling really productive at work and really wanted to disconnect from all attachments to any responsibility. It continued with the crappy music they picked for three hours of car ride, followed by some empty pastime discussions. I was not happy about how it was going, but the worst part was the games between my partner and her sister. When I mention games I'm talking about nonverbal discounts happening on otherwise normal social exchanges. Really unconfortable stuff if you ask me. If you do not know what I'm talking about or you want to know more about the topic you should read `TA Today`. Well, the adventure kept adding layers of crap until at some point one of those discounts was directed to me. And I blew up.

So, what happened here? **Assumptions** about why the other person was doing what she was doing, **lack of self-awareness** and **lack of action** to stop the issue before grew for fear of exposing the problem, and by extension my weakness to those attacks.

What could have happened instead? I could have validated my assumptions by asking about the context of the attacks with a focus on the facts, not the person. I could have asked about what was going on in the life of the person, where she was feeling the pressure and what was her expectations of the situation. And finally I could have communicated my issues with the situation, expose my expectations and I could have done this at the very first signs of issues. Would this change in behavior had the situation changed? I do not know, and I'll never know for sure. What I do know is that I did nothing to understand and correct the situation until I lost control, and I can not regret it more.

But wait a moment, she could do the same right? Yes, but so could I, and I did not do it because I was too busy thinking about my own agenda. So was she I can wait for others to take the first step, but if everyone is waiting, no one will get anywhere. There is no improvement without effort, taking the first step is necessary and I shall not wait for others to do it on my behalf.

So future self, if this situation seems familiar to you, you are doing it wrong, you must keep it in mind, everyone has their own agenda, you may or not be part of it, and if you want to avoid conflicts and take advantage of people's good will, understand their agenda and make your agenda visible to others. Transparency is key for good understanding.

Want to change the world? Start by addressing yourself.

And this brings me to the next point, to change the world I must first look at my reflection in the mirror. I can not expect others to attend to reason without myself reasoning first. I always dreamed of making a difference, changing the world, or like some people say at Repositive, curing cancer. That is still the case, but the how has now changed. I do not believe I will be able to make such a substantial change on my own, but I can help and empower others to do so.

I believe this is one of the problems with my generation, entitlement. The world is full of injustice, that doesn't mean I am the bright knight that will put end to it. Before I take care of others I must take care of myself first, find what is that I can do to improve my situation will potentially improve the situation of those around me. Again, lets present a situation that will prove the point.

I have a problem with sleep habits. I do not usually have problems sleeping, but it takes me a hell of effort to go to bed on time, it is a habit from my student days, when I used to spend nights on end doing other alternative activities to sleep. I used to think sleep was for the weak and I took pride of sleeping as little as 5 hours a night, some of my friends still think I do. The reasoning behind this may be a story for another day, but for now lets focus on the repercusions of this bad habit. If I do not sleep I usually have a light migrain and I'm pretty grumpy, you can ask anyone at Repositive, I won't be a nice chap to have by your side that day.

If it wasn't bad enought by itself that my performance is reduced, if you take into consideration that my work affects others, their performance is also reduced, and you can follow the chain if you will until you are bored. A hit on my performance is a hit on the performance of the team, the same applies the other way around.

So what do I need to do to make a change in the world? Start by solving my own issues. That will by itself make a change in the world, it may not be the big change I was looking for, it it will be a change where I will notice the most.

Future self, you may be wondering, mini-me, why the hell did you decide to publish all this crap on the internet? Easy, I do not have anything to loose by doing so, the only things that can damage me are those topics that I am not self-aware of or that I fear will put me at risk, and so far I am writing only about those that I have control of, and lets be honest, you and me know that there are others I'll have to get a hold on before I publicly speak about them. Some people may say they do not have anything to hide, that is not my case in the present, but I'm sure It will be in the future. By the time you read this I hope you to have resolved those concerns, if not, keep at it, I know you can do it.

To succeed you need to develop your own ideas.

During the last year I've been reading a lot, 25 books, but you know what? I already forgot half of what I have read. Not cool, but I have a plan. Reading was the first step, deriving the ideas and building my own is the next. Let me take a deviation here to present a little story about the remarkable art of cooking.

You probably know already, but the phrase `we are what we eat` is true. If you want to keep healthy and performing well you must have a good diversity of food ingredients and those must be of high quality. Pre-processed foods, while tasty, usually do not apport all the nutrients needed and they are too easy to digest, providing lots of calory intake with little micronutrients. On the other side of the coin we have eating raw, it is nice, but I enjoy much more cooked meals. You can go to a nice restaurant from time to time for a gourmet experience, but finding those is hard and expensive. The other option is to put time and effort in learning how to cook and how to assemble a balance diet, and I can even enjoy it with the right mindset. I enables me to pick high quality ingredients and I can control my intaque to optimize for my daily goals, like exercising or doing some mental effort.

Now think of the previous paragraph as changing the ingredients for ideas. We are used of receiving hundreds of ideas every day through social media, the majority of them are so processed that is difficult to see where the initial idea actually came from and the quality is hard to asses. The result of this is that it is becoming harder to think by myself, to create new concepts and to defend my ideology. The plan to overcome this is simple, I'm on a diet. It's not a starvation diet, is a high quality intaque diet. I'll have to obtain the ingredients raw of half cooked, and I'll need to prepare the final dish myself.

Why is this important? Did you ever talked with an airhead? What is so irritating about this characters? They do not pay attention to anything else than their ongoing routine, is difficult to exchange ideas and their reasoning has the depth of a puddle. A diverse range of ideas is required to enhance the understanding of peoples intentions and the only way to be able to cumunicate complex topics effectively is by composing this ideas, it requires a lot of practice. From experience observing other I know that well articulated thoughts will enable me to clarify any type of situation. You need to know how to cook if you want to explain a recipe and get all the potential flavour out of the ingredients, tasting the dish is not enough.

Plan for idle time

To summarise:
  - We live in a world of adults. Behave and expect people to behave as such.
  - Plan for iddle time.
